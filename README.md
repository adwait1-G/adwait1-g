### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I am Adwaith, currently working as a software engineer at Cisco Systems, Bangalore. I am part of Cisco's MIG(Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group) security team. A lot of interesting, exciting things are happening at the moment. I graduated with a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology Karnataka, batch of 2020.

I explored offensive security during my college days - vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, reverse engineering, writing security tools etc., Currently, I find defense fascinating. I have found out that defense is way harder and exciting. Never actually appreciated how interesting Theoritical Computer Science is and how it can be used to build secure systems - formal verification, automata theory etc., are changing the way systems are designed. My interest areas are programming languages, formal logic and verification(noober than a noob) and just anything low level!

Re(searching) for a silver bullet to build bug free, verifiably correct, secure systems. Rust might be it.

I blog [here](https://www.pwnthebox.net/). Most of it tech related, but sometimes I rant too.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on understanding Rust better. Trying to do a quantitative comparison with C. If time permits, I want to give a comparison with Go as well. You can checkout my findings [here](https://www.pwnthebox.net/rust/2020/10/11/rust-c-experiments.html).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently crazy about event driven programming!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything low level, binaries, compilers, programming languages, Rust, systems programming you get the point :P
